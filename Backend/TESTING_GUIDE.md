# SkillSwap Platform Manual Testing Guide

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure your backend server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Server should be running on `http://localhost:3000`

## Test Flow

### 1. Register Two Users

**User 1 (Alice) - JavaScript Developer:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "skillsOffered": ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"],
    "skillsWanted": ["Python", "Machine Learning"],
    "bio": "Full-stack developer looking to learn AI/ML"
  }'
```

**User 2 (Bob) - Python Developer:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Bob Smith",
    "email": "bob@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "skillsOffered": ["Python", "Machine Learning", "Data Analysis"],
    "skillsWanted": ["React", "Frontend Development"],
    "bio": "Data scientist interested in web development"
  }'
```

Save the tokens from both responses!

### 2. Search for Users (as Alice)

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/users/search?skill=Python" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ALICE_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Create Swap Request (Alice wants to learn Python from Bob)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/swaps/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "providerId": "BOB_USER_ID_FROM_SEARCH",
    "skillRequested": "Python",
    "skillOffered": "React",
    "message": "Hi! I would love to learn Python from you in exchange for React tutoring.",
    "preferredDuration": 60
  }'
```

### 4. Accept Swap Request and Schedule Meeting (as Bob)

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/swaps/SWAP_REQUEST_ID/accept \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BOB_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "scheduledDate": "2025-07-13T14:00:00.000Z",
    "duration": 60
  }'
```

### 5. Check Upcoming Meetings (as Alice)

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/swaps/meetings/upcoming \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ALICE_TOKEN"
```

### 6. Test the Meeting Link

The response from step 4 will include a **Jit.si meeting link** like:
```
https://meet.jit.si/skillswap-1720800000000-abc123#config.roomPassword=&config.subject=Skill%20Swap%3A%20React%20%E2%86%94%20Python
```

**Copy this link and open it in your browser** - it will create a real video meeting room!

## Expected Results

âœ… **Step 1:** Both users registered successfully with tokens  
âœ… **Step 2:** Search returns Bob as a Python skill provider  
âœ… **Step 3:** Swap request created successfully  
âœ… **Step 4:** Meeting scheduled with real Jit.si link generated  
âœ… **Step 5:** Upcoming meetings shows the scheduled session  
âœ… **Step 6:** Meeting link opens functional video conference  

## Testing Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**
- **Skill-based Search**
- **Swap Request Lifecycle**
- **Real Meeting Generation with Jit.si**
- **Meeting Scheduling & Management**

## Additional API Endpoints to Test

```bash
# Get user profile
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get my swap requests
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/swaps/my-requests \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Update meeting status to "in_progress"
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/swaps/meetings/MEETING_ID/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"status": "in_progress"}'

# Complete the meeting
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/swaps/meetings/MEETING_ID/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"status": "completed"}'
```
